Flutter seems pretty promising and cryptos are fun; so why not merge the two?

NOTE: This is a **work in progress**.


## Features

+ Fetch crypto prices from the [api](http://api.coinmarketcap.com) and render as a list
+ Basic detail rending of the coins on a separate Router
+ Crude search feature among the coin names and symbols, etc
+ Android Snackbar for displaying network errors
+ Basic Flutter widget testing

##### Todo :
- [ ] Improved UI for details including charts and responsive sizing
- [ ] Automatic update of prices every n minutes
- [ ] Better routing management

## Flutter Setup
